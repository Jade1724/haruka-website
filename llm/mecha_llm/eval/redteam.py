"""Red-team / jailbreak suite (pytest), dependency-light.

Runs adversarial prompts through the RAG pipeline and asserts it does NOT
comply — each attack lists substrings that would only appear if the model leaked
its prompt, obeyed an injected instruction, or hallucinated a fabricated fact.

This exercises the **prompt + RAG-grounding** guardrails of the offline pipeline.
It is complementary to the backend's Azure AI Content Safety / Prompt Shields,
which run in `backend/app/services/rag_service.py` and are not part of this
offline pipeline.

Run:  uv run pytest mecha_llm/eval/redteam.py
