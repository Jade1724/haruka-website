"""Thin async wrapper around Azure AI Foundry: streaming chat generation.

Mirrors the simplicity of ``email.py`` — module-level functions over a client
that ``main.py`` creates once (in the lifespan) and shares via ``app.state``.
Query embeddings moved to ``local_embeddings`` (bge, on-device); this module now
only handles chat generation.

The model is chosen entirely by ``settings.azure_openai_chat_deployment``, so
this is the single place a model swap touches. Request parameters are kept
minimal and configurable because Foundry hosts non-OpenAI models (DeepSeek et al)
that don't all accept the same knobs.
